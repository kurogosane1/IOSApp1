### How to Use
There are 2 ways of rolling the dice. 
1. simply press the roll button
2. shake the iphone to have the dices rolled and have a new face.



It was made using simple UI images and coding very little swift. 
Inorder to run this. Make sure to have a apple account and change the team. 

Run it on xcode via simulation!
